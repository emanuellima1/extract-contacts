# Extract Contacts

A simple Python script to extract contacts that obey a search string from a vCard file. The script accepts a .vcf file and a string, searches for the string on the contacts' name and returns an Excel spreadsheet with the names and their telephones.

Usage:

```bash
./extract_contacts [FILE] [STRING]
```
